Quantara Lending Adapter Module

This module provides an abstraction layer for lending protocol interactions
in the Stellar ecosystem. It replaces the former Starknet-specific ZkLend integration
and provides a protocol-agnostic interface for lending/borrowing operations.

The adapter pattern allows Quantara to support multiple Stellar-native lending
protocols through a unified interface.
